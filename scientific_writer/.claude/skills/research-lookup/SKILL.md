# Research Information Lookup

## Overview

This skill provides real-time research information lookup with **intelligent backend routing**:

- **Parallel Chat API** (`core` model): Default backend for all general research queries. Provides comprehensive, multi-source research reports with inline citations via the OpenAI-compatible Chat API at `https://api.parallel.ai`.
- **Perplexity sonar-pro-search** (via OpenRouter): Used only for academic-specific paper searches where scholarly database access is critical.

The skill automatically detects query type and routes to the optimal backend.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need:

- **Current Research Information**: Latest studies, papers, and findings
- **Literature Verification**: Check facts, statistics, or claims against current research
- **Background Research**: Gather context and supporting evidence for scientific writing
- **Citation Sources**: Find relevant papers and studies to cite
- **Technical Documentation**: Look up specifications, protocols, or methodologies
- **Market/Industry Data**: Current statistics, trends, competitive intelligence
- **Recent Developments**: Emerging trends, breakthroughs, announcements

## Visual Enhancement with Scientific Schematics

**When creating documents with this skill, always consider adding scientific diagrams and schematics to enhance visual communication.**

If your document does not already contain schematics or diagrams:
- Use the **scientific-schematics** skill to generate AI-powered publication-quality diagrams
- Simply describe your desired diagram in natural language

```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "your diagram description" -o figures/output.png
```

## Automatic Backend Selection

The skill automatically routes queries to the best backend based on content:

### Routing Logic

```
Query arrives
    |
    +-- Contains academic keywords? (papers, DOI, journal, peer-reviewed, etc.)
    |       YES --> Perplexity sonar-pro-search (academic search mode)
    |
    +-- Everything else (general research, market data, technical info, analysis)
            --> Parallel Chat API (core model)
```

### Academic Keywords (Routes to Perplexity)

Queries containing these terms are routed to Perplexity for academic-focused search:

- Paper finding: `find papers`, `find articles`, `research papers on`, `published studies`
- Citations: `cite`, `citation`, `doi`, `pubmed`, `pmid`
- Academic sources: `peer-reviewed`, `journal article`, `scholarly`, `arxiv`, `preprint`
- Review types: `systematic review`, `meta-analysis`, `literature search`
- Paper quality: `foundational papers`, `seminal papers`, `landmark papers`, `highly cited`

### Everything Else (Routes to Parallel)

All other queries go to the Parallel Chat API (core model), including:

- General research questions
- Market and industry analysis
- Technical information and documentation
- Current events and recent developments
- Comparative analysis
- Statistical data retrieval
- Complex analytical queries

### Manual Override

You can force a specific backend:

```bash
# Force Parallel Deep Research
python research_lookup.py "your query" --force-backend parallel

# Force Perplexity academic search
python research_lookup.py "your query" --force-backend perplexity
```

## MANDATORY: Save All Results to Sources Folder

**Every research-lookup result MUST be saved to the project's `sources/` folder.**

This is non-negotiable. Research results are expensive to obtain and critical for reproducibility.

### Saving Rules

| Backend | `-o` Flag Target | Filename Pattern |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Parallel Deep Research | `sources/research_<topic>.md` | `research_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<brief_topic>.md` |
| Perplexity (academic) | `sources/papers_<topic>.md` | `papers_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<brief_topic>.md` |
| Batch queries | `sources/batch_<topic>.md` | `batch_research_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<brief_topic>.md` |

### How to Save

**CRITICAL: Every call to `research_lookup.py` MUST include the `-o` flag pointing to the `sources/` folder.**

**CRITICAL: Saved files MUST preserve all citations, source URLs, and DOIs.** The default text output automatically includes a `Sources` section (with title, date, URL for each source) and an `Additional References` section (with DOIs and academic URLs extracted from the response text). For maximum citation metadata, use `--json`.

```bash
# General research — save to sources/ (includes Sources + Additional References sections)
python research_lookup.py "Recent advances in CRISPR gene editing 2025" \
  -o sources/research_20250217_143000_crispr_advances.md

# Academic paper search — save to sources/ (includes paper citations with DOIs)
python research_lookup.py "Find papers on transformer attention mechanisms in NeurIPS 2024" \
  -o sources/papers_20250217_143500_transformer_attention.md

# JSON format for maximum citation metadata (full citation objects with URLs, DOIs, snippets)
python research_lookup.py "CRISPR clinical trials" --json \
  -o sources/research_20250217_143000_crispr_trials.json

# Forced backend — save to sources/
python research_lookup.py "AI regulation landscape" --force-backend parallel \
  -o sources/research_20250217_144000_ai_regulation.md

# Batch queries — save to sources/
python research_lookup.py --batch "mRNA vaccines efficacy" "mRNA vaccines safety" \
  -o sources/batch_research_20250217_144500_mrna_vaccines.md
```

### Citation Preservation in Saved Files

Each output format preserves citations differently:

| Format | Citations Included | When to Use |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Text (default) | `Sources (N):` section with `[title] (date) + URL` + `Additional References (N):` with DOIs and academic URLs | Standard use — human-readable with all citations |
| JSON (`--json`) | Full citation objects: `url`, `title`, `date`, `snippet`, `doi`, `type` | When you need maximum citation metadata |

**For Parallel backend**, saved files include: research report + Sources list (title, URL) + Additional References (DOIs, academic URLs).
**For Perplexity backend**, saved files include: academic summary + Sources list (title, date, URL, snippet) + Additional References (DOIs, academic URLs).

**Use `--json` when you need to:**
- Parse citation metadata programmatically
- Preserve full DOI and URL data for BibTeX generation
- Maintain the structured citation objects for cross-referencing

### Why Save Everything

1. **Reproducibility**: Every citation and claim can be traced back to its raw research source
2. **Context Window Recovery**: If context is compacted, saved results can be re-read without re-querying
3. **Audit Trail**: The `sources/` folder documents exactly how all research information was gathered
4. **Reuse Across Sections**: Multiple sections can reference the same saved research without duplicate queries
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Check `sources/` for existing results before making new API calls
6. **Peer Review Support**: Reviewers can verify the research backing every citation

### Before Making a New Query, Check Sources First

Before calling `research_lookup.py`, check if a relevant result already exists:

```bash
ls sources/  # Check existing saved results
```

If a prior lookup covers the same topic, re-read the saved file instead of making a new API call.

### Logging

When saving research results, always log:

```
[HH:MM:SS] SAVED: Research lookup to sources/research_20250217_143000_crispr_advances.md (3,800 words, 8 citations)
[HH:MM:SS] SAVED: Paper search to sources/papers_20250217_143500_transformer_attention.md (6 papers found)
```

## Integration with Scientific Writing

This skill enhances scientific writing by providing:

1. **Literature Review Support**: Gather current research for introduction and discussion — **save to `sources/`**
2. **Methods Validation**: Verify protocols against current standards — **save to `sources/`**
3. **Results Contextualization**: Compare findings with recent similar studies — **save to `sources/`**
4. **Discussion Enhancement**: Support arguments with latest evidence — **save to `sources/`**
5. **Citation Management**: Provide properly formatted citations — **save to `sources/`**

## Complementary Tools

## Error Handling and Limitations

**Known Limitations:**
- Parallel Chat API (core model): Complex queries may take up to 5 minutes
- Perplexity: Information cutoff, may not access full text behind paywalls
- Both: Cannot access proprietary or restricted databases

**Fallback Behavior:**
- If the selected backend's API key is missing, tries the other backend
- If both backends fail, returns structured error response
- Rephrase queries for better results if initial response is insufficient
